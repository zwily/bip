2009-01-24 (0.8.x)
Visible changes:
- One logfile per nick for queries, instead of the messy privates.x.log
  Slight log format change (now the format of the log of queries is very
  similar to the on used for channels)
- "Window"-local blreset and blreset on talk. By default the blreset_on_talk
  now only clears the backlog of the query you talked to or the channel you
  talked to.  The /quote bip blreset command now can take a query name or a
  channel name as an argument. "/quote bip blreset" still resets the backlog of
  the whole network.
- /quote bip backlog x command where x is the number of hours will backlog x
  hours.
- autorejoin on kick by default. Can be disabled with the option
  autojoin_on_kick = false in a connection block.
- bip SSL on the client<->bip part now support Ephemeral Diffie Hellman key
  exchange.

What's to expect in bip now:
- Support kill -HUP and /bip reload cleanly.
- Close/reopen files on sighup.
- Have some reply when running BIP commands.  ssl_check_mode, always_backlog,
  backlog, bl_msg_only, backlog_lines, backlog_no_timestamp, blreset_on_talk be
  settable at the connection block rather than the user block.
- Add backlog option to channels. Useful if you don't care about one particular
  channel.
- bip_use_notice: Add this option to receive bip message through notices.
- Make SSL "basic" certificate check more loose (more SSH-like).  In "basic"
  mode, normally un trusted certificates get to be trusted if they manually
  trusted by user. This provides an SSH like private key auth mechani Expired
  certificates were considered invalid in this mode which does not make much
  sense.
- blreset: add -q option to /bip blreset command if you don't want it to reply
  anything (for scripts).
- Support add_conn and del_conn bip commands for live connection addition and
  removal.
- Have a bold arrow to highligh your own word on private messages and multiple
  connected clients.

09-12-2007: Bip has now two types of users "admins" and normal user. Some
commands are reserved to admin. Add a admin = true; statement in your config
(in user block) accordingly.

29-10-2007: Certificate validation change. In "basic" mode, expired
certificates are now accepted as long as they are in store (therefore trusted).
This makes the basic mode be more SSH like. Some extreme security zealots might
want to be warned.

02-09-2007: as of now log parameters go in the user {} statment. This breaks
every config and there is no backwrads compatibility as of now.
Lots of internal changes, expect crashes.
